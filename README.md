## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)
The site now supports **en-GB** and **pt-BR** with a lightweight, framework-free setup:

- Copy is stored in `/i18n/en.json` and `/i18n/pt-BR.json` using semantic keys.
- `/scripts/i18n.js` loads translations, updates `<html lang>`, and persists the selected language in `localStorage`.
- Text nodes map via `data-i18n`, while HTML fragments (like inline code or links) use `data-i18n-html`.
- A language switcher in the header keeps the experience accessible and consistent across pages.
