# About Me

Hey there! I'm Eduardo, and my main goal is entrepreneurship. I love solving problems with technology, leveraging my strong logic programming skills. I adapt to the tech demands of each project, be it programming languages or databases.

## Skills and Learning

Constantly fueling my creativity, I enjoy envisioning new software solutions. While I'm yet to embark on significant projects, each endeavor teaches me something new.

## Language Palette

Fluent in Portuguese and English, with a dash of Spanish. Next on my linguistic journey: Mandarin, French, German, Russian, and Arabic.

## Challenges and Values

In the entrepreneurial realm, my challenge lies in finding a partner whose strengths complement mine. I highly value collaborative work and believe in the power of teamwork.

## Personal Interests

Beyond tech, my interests include languages, the vastness of the sea, spirituality, and the arts.
